# Portfolio Index

This repository aggregates five projects designed to showcase the skills required of an Artificial Intelligence Specialist in the Gas Operations domain.  Each project addresses a common challenge—anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, safety assistance, energy optimisation and emissions reduction—and follows a structured README format (Problem → Data → Method → Metrics → Ops → Cyber → Value).

- **P1_Compressor_Anomaly**: Multivariate anomaly detection for compressors using Isolation Forest and LSTM autoencoders.
- **P2_RUL_Predictive_Maintenance**: Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation via survival analysis.
- **P3_RAG_Safety_Copilot**: A retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) co‑pilot for procedural and safety documents with guardrails.
- **P4_Energy_Setpoint_Optimization**: Safe Bayesian optimisation to reduce energy consumption while respecting process envelopes.
- **P5_Emissions_Flaring_Reduction**: Seasonal baseline modelling and changepoint detection to reduce nuisance flaring alarms.

Please consult each project’s README and model card for specific assumptions, dependencies and operating instructions.
