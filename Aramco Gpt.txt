How to run (local)
# 1) train
python train.py

# If using LSTM, write the feature count (8 by default)
echo 8 > models/gasops_anomaly_meta.txt

# 2) serve
uvicorn serve:app --reload

# 3) score a CSV (you can export from data_gen or your own)
python cli_score.py --csv my_validation.csv


Adapting to real plants

Replace data_gen.get_train_val() with PI/OPC retrieval. For PI: use PI Web API to pull tag series, align timestamps, mark labels through historical work orders (if available).

Keep your train on “good” data policy; apply backtesting on periods with known events; pick alert thresholds to meet operator alarm budgets (e.g., ≤0.1 false alarms/hr/asset).

10) Value Tracking & Business Framing (speaks funding language)

Baseline: Current downtime hrs, energy cost (SAR/kWh or fuel), emissions factors, alarm counts.

Expected impact per project: “−X% downtime” or “−Y% false alarms” or “−Z% energy.”

Translate to SAR and CO₂-e with explicit formulas; show error bars (±).

Board slide: one graph per metric, monthly trend, confidence bands, and notes on confounders.

11) Networking & Application Tactics

Find the Gas Operations technical leaders and AI champions; share a short 1-pager (your A1 + dashboard screenshot + GitHub links).

Publish a technical blog on anomaly detection in rotating equipment with code excerpts (no corporate data).

Ask for a 30-min technical coffee to discuss your pilot plan and how you measure operator trust & alarm fatigue.

Tailor your LinkedIn headline to:
“AI for Gas Ops | Time-Series Reliability | OPC UA/PI | 62443-aware | Value-Tracked PoC→Scale.”

Final Notes (what will get you accepted)

Show Oil & Gas-specific artifacts (OPC/PI, 62443, value tracking).

Ship at least 3 working repos (P1–P3) with readmes that speak in business metrics.

Arrive interview-ready with exact answers on alarm fatigue, drift, zone/conduit security, and pilot rollout governance.

Attach the Power BI “Value Tracking” screenshot to your application.

If you want, I can also convert this into a ready-to-send resume + cover letter with your real numbers, and build the Power BI mock using your KPI targets.

Final tip (what Aramco reviewers will love)

Tie every model result to a plant-relevant constraint and a risk-aware control narrative (SafeOpt envelope for P4; “operator confirm” rail for P3; false-alarm/hour & lead-time for P1; censored data & confidence bands for P2; regulatory context & tags for P5). Back it with the exact standards/docs above, so your README reads like an internal technical package rather than a generic ML demo.

If you want, I can turn this into a printable, step-by-step study tracker with links and a repo template structure.

based on the first part of the isolationForest, explain each code line and how we would generate data related to our Multivariate Anomaly Detection for Compressors targeted for Aramco: IsolationForest example 
An example using IsolationForest for anomaly detection.

The Isolation Forest is an ensemble of “Isolation Trees” that “isolate” observations by recursive random partitioning, which can be represented by a tree structure. The number of splittings required to isolate a sample is lower for outliers and higher for inliers.

In the present example we demo two ways to visualize the decision boundary of an Isolation Forest trained on a toy dataset.

# Authors: The scikit-learn developers
# SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause
Data generation
We generate two clusters (each one containing n_samples) by randomly sampling the standard normal distribution as returned by numpy.random.randn. One of them is spherical and the other one is slightly deformed.

For consistency with the IsolationForest notation, the inliers (i.e. the gaussian clusters) are assigned a ground truth label 1 whereas the outliers (created with numpy.random.uniform) are assigned the label -1.

import numpy as np

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

n_samples, n_outliers = 120, 40
rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
covariance = np.array([[0.5, -0.1], [0.7, 0.4]])
cluster_1 = 0.4 * rng.randn(n_samples, 2) @ covariance + np.array([2, 2])  # general
cluster_2 = 0.3 * rng.randn(n_samples, 2) + np.array([-2, -2])  # spherical
outliers = rng.uniform(low=-4, high=4, size=(n_outliers, 2))

X = np.concatenate([cluster_1, cluster_2, outliers])
y = np.concatenate(
    [np.ones((2 * n_samples), dtype=int), -np.ones((n_outliers), dtype=int)]
)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, random_state=42)
We can visualize the resulting clusters:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

scatter = plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, s=20, edgecolor="k")
handles, labels = scatter.legend_elements()
plt.axis("square")
plt.legend(handles=handles, labels=["outliers", "inliers"], title="true class")
plt.title("Gaussian inliers with \nuniformly distributed outliers")
plt.show()
Gaussian inliers with  uniformly distributed outliers
قال ChatGPT:

Great question. I’ll do two things:

walk you line-by-line through the toy IsolationForest data-generation snippet you pasted, so every symbol is crystal-clear,

give you a production-style, fully functional Python script that generates realistic compressor telemetry (flow, suction/discharge pressure, vibration, motor current, temperature), injects multiple industrial-style faults, builds rolling-window features, trains IsolationForest, and reports AUROC, false-alarm/hour, and detection delay per event. This is the exact shape you can evolve into your Aramco portfolio repo.

Part A — Line-by-line: the toy IsolationForest data generation
import numpy as np


Loads NumPy for numerical arrays and random sampling.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split


Utility to split arrays into train/test while preserving label ratios if needed (stratify).

n_samples, n_outliers = 120, 40


You’ll draw two inlier clusters with n_samples points each (so 240 inliers total) and 40 outliers.

rng = np.random.RandomState(0)


A fixed pseudorandom generator for reproducibility. (Using this instead of global state means you always get the same random numbers.)

covariance = np.array([[0.5, -0.1], [0.7, 0.4]])


A 2×2 matrix used as a linear transform to “deform” one Gaussian cluster (stretch + rotate).
Note: They call it covariance, but it’s not guaranteed to be a valid covariance matrix; here it’s just a transform.

cluster_1 = 0.4 * rng.randn(n_samples, 2) @ covariance + np.array([2, 2])  # general


rng.randn(n_samples, 2) → 120 samples from a standard 2D Gaussian centered at (0,0).

@ covariance → linear transformation (rotate/scale/shear).

0.4 * ... → shrinks dispersion.

+ [2,2] → shifts the center to (2,2).

Result: a deformed Gaussian blob near (2,2).

cluster_2 = 0.3 * rng.randn(n_samples, 2) + np.array([-2, -2])  # spherical


A more spherical blob, smaller spread (0.3), centered at (-2,-2).

outliers = rng.uniform(low=-4, high=4, size=(n_outliers, 2))


40 points uniformly scattered across a big square, likely far from the clusters → “obvious” anomalies.

X = np.concatenate([cluster_1, cluster_2, outliers])


Stack all points into one feature matrix X of shape (240 + 40, 2).

y = np.concatenate(
    [np.ones((2 * n_samples), dtype=int), -np.ones((n_outliers), dtype=int)]
)


Labels: by IsolationForest convention, inliers = +1, outliers = −1. So 240 times +1, then 40 times −1.

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, random_state=42)


Randomly split data while preserving the class ratio (stratify=y). random_state fixes the split for reproducibility.

Plotting (optional but illustrative):

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

scatter = plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, s=20, edgecolor="k")
handles, labels = scatter.legend_elements()
plt.axis("square")
plt.legend(handles=handles, labels=["outliers", "inliers"], title="true class")
plt.title("Gaussian inliers with \nuniformly distributed outliers")
plt.show()


Simple scatter colored by y. axis("square") makes equal scaling. Legend elements are auto-built from colors.

Key takeaway: this toy setup creates two clean Gaussian clusters (inliers) and uniform noise (outliers). It’s perfect for visualizing decision boundaries, but it’s not what compressors look like.

Part B — Compressor-realistic IsolationForest (full, runnable)

Below is a self-contained script that:

Simulates multivariate compressor telemetry at 1-minute resolution (flow, suction/discharge pressure, vibration, motor current, temperature) with realistic correlations and diurnal effects.

Injects four industrial faults (bearing vibration spike, suction blockage/pressure imbalance, motor overload, thermal runaway).

Builds rolling-window features (means, std, deltas) per signal → this is how you give a pointwise model like IsolationForest some temporal context.

Trains IsolationForest on normal periods, scores the test set, and reports:

AUROC

False-alarms/hour

Detection delay (minutes) for each injected event

Prints a concise report you can paste into your README’s Method/Metrics/Value sections.

Save as compressor_if_demo.py and run with python compressor_if_demo.py.

Why this mirrors real compressors (and Aramco needs)

Correlated physics: Ps & Pd move with flow; current with load; temperature lags current (thermal inertia).

Industrial faults: classic signatures—bearing vibration spike, suction restriction (pressure imbalance), motor overload, thermal runaway.

Temporal features: IsolationForest is pointwise; rolling mean/std/min/max/diff gives it 30-minute context.

Operator-relevant metrics: AUROC is nice, but false-alarms/hour and detection delay (min) speak directly to alarm fatigue and lead time—exactly what an operations team will ask.

Reproducible: seeded randomness, documented parameters → you can tune and show deltas.

What to tweak as you move from synthetic → plant data

Window: set to your historian scan rate (e.g., 10 s sampling → 5–10 min windows).

Tag QA: drop or mark bad-quality samples; forward-fill gaps up to a safe limit; never silently interpolate long gaps.

Thresholding: choose the alarm budget with control room (e.g., ≤0.1 FA/hr/asset), then back-solve the quantile.

Explainability: for IF, add per-feature deviation plots around alarms (e.g., z-scores vs baseline) so operators see why it fired.

Value: tie detections to saved downtime or reduced incidents in your README’s Value section.

If you’d like, I can extend this with a tiny OPC UA/PI Web API stub so your README shows the exact connectors Aramco teams expect, plus a Power BI “Value Tracking” mock page.

قام بالتفكير لمدة 41s

Fantastic question. Here’s the thinking behind that self-contained script—what each part is grounded on—and a practical decision framework to know when you should keep this structure as-is versus build it differently for Aramco’s Gas Ops context.

1) Why those parts? (Design principles → OT reality)
A. Multivariate compressor telemetry with realistic coupling + diurnal effects

Based on: how centrifugal/reciprocating compressor trains behave in plants.

Physical coupling: Flow, suction/discharge pressures (Ps/Pd), motor current (load), temperature (thermal inertia), and vibration are not independent. If flow rises, Pd typically rises, current rises (load ↑), and after a lag, temperature rises. That correlation pattern is essential for a multivariate detector to distinguish “physically consistent” vs “inconsistent” states.

Diurnal/shift cycles: Many plants exhibit demand cycles (day/night, shift changes, upstream process schedules). Ignoring this creates systematic false alarms. Simulating a mild daily seasonality forces the model + features to cope with real baselines.

Keep this structure when: your tags are clearly coupled and you see daily/weekly cycles in the historian.
Change it when: the asset runs at near-constant load (no diurnal), or when strong supervisory control flattens variations—then seasonality is minimal and you can simplify.

B. Four injected fault archetypes

Based on: common failure modes/fault signatures you’ll meet in operations reviews/FMECA:

Bearing degradation → vibration spike/jitter

Suction restriction → Ps↓, Pd↑, flow↓ (ΔP increase)

Motor overload → current surge (+ mild vib)

Thermal runaway → slow temperature ramp (harder, collective anomaly)

These give you point anomalies (sudden spikes) and collective/contextual anomalies (slow ramps, correlated deviations), ensuring the detector is tested beyond toy outliers.

Keep this structure when: your plant fault library overlaps these patterns (very common).
Change it when: your critical faults differ (e.g., seal gas issues, recycle valve misbehavior, surge proximity, lubrication failures). Then encode those signatures instead, preferably derived from a quick FMECA with SMEs.

C. Rolling-window features for a pointwise model (IsolationForest)

Based on: IsolationForest (IF) scores each row independently; compressors are temporal systems.
Rolling means/std/min/max/diff over ~30 minutes inject local time context (trend, volatility, step changes) without changing the model class.

Keep this structure when: you need a fast, robust unsupervised baseline, have uneven labels, and want transparent features.
Change it when:

The process has multiple operating modes (startup/steady/ramp). Either (a) build mode-specific models (stratify by mode), or (b) add a “mode” feature (setpoint, valve position, speed) and/or learn on residuals (see Alternatives below).

You need sequence learning (long temporal dependencies): then consider LSTM/TCN/VAE (model the sequence directly, not rolled stats).

Window length rule of thumb: start at 3–5× the dominant time constant of the slowest tag you care about (often temperature or pressure control response). If scan rate = 1 min and thermal constant ≈ 6–10 min, try 30 min first; sweep 10–60 min and pick the best alarm cost curve (hit rate vs false-alarms/hour).

D. Train on “normal only”, pick a threshold from an alarm budget

Based on: common reality—labels are scarce; ops teams think in budgeted alarms, not statistical purity.

Train IF on normal windows (or on all data but select threshold using normal quantiles).

Choose threshold by policy: e.g., “≤0.1 false alarms per hour per asset.” Derive the score quantile that meets that budget on a normal validation slice.

Keep this structure when: you mainly have unlabeled data and must guarantee low false-alarm rates.
Change it when: you have reliable labels/events; then use supervised/semi-supervised methods or calibrate threshold to maximize event-level utility (e.g., minimize cost with different costs for misses vs false alarms).

E. Metrics chosen to match control room concerns

Based on: what operators and managers ask in reviews:

AUROC / AUPRC: model discrimination summary (for data science).

False-alarms/hour: direct proxy for alarm fatigue.

Detection delay (min): lead time before the event peaks → maintenance & intervention value.

Keep these when: presenting to operations.
Add/change when: your site tracks nuisance alarm rate, mean time between false alarms (MTBFA), or detection probability at fixed FA/h—report those too.

2) How to know if you need this structure or a different one (decision checklist)

Work through this quick triage with your historian sample (1–3 months):

Do tags move together physically? (Ps/Pd/flow/current/temp/vib show correlated changes)

Yes → multivariate approach like IF + rolling features is appropriate.

No / mostly independent → consider per-tag univariate models and late fusion (vote/score aggregation).

Strong operating modes or setpoint regimes? (startup, ramp, steady, recycle)

Yes → stratify models by mode or model residuals after a baseline forecaster (below).

No → single model with rolling features often suffices.

Temporal dynamics important? (faults are ramps, not spikes)

Yes → keep rolling features or move to sequence models (LSTM/TCN/VAE).

No → simpler snapshot features can work.

Label quality?

Sparse/uncertain → unsupervised IF/AE + alarm budget thresholding.

Reliable labels → supervised detectors, cost-sensitive thresholds.

Performance constraints?

Strict low-latency (edge), modest CPU → rolled-feature + IF is lightweight and production-friendly.

Ample compute/GPU → consider deep sequence models.

Scale (many similar assets)?

Homogeneous fleet → global model with per-asset calibration.

Heterogeneous → per-asset models or hierarchical approach (global pretrain + local fine-tune).

Alarm policy fixed by site?

Yes → design threshold to meet FA/h and report lead time at that operating point.

If ≥5 of these lean to the left column, your current structure is a solid starting point. If multiple lean to the right, use the alternatives below.

3) When to rebuild differently (concrete scenarios → prescription)

Multiple regimes / setpoints dominate behavior → Learn a baseline forecaster (ARIMA/Prophet/ETS or LSTM) per tag, compute residuals, then run IF on residual stacks. This removes predictable regime effects and cuts false alarms.

Mode switches are explicit (speed, recycle valve, load step) → Train one model per mode, switch by a small rules engine; or include mode as a feature and enforce mode-aware thresholds.

Vibration is the leading indicator → Engineer spectral features (RMS in bands, kurtosis, crest factor, envelope) and feed those to IF/AE (or do a dedicated vibration model + fuse with process tags).

Slow drift sensors (temp/pressure bias drift) → add trend/detrend features, or use change-point detectors in parallel; combine with IF votes.

You have many labeled events (~50+) → train a classifier (e.g., gradient boosting) on the same rolling features, and keep IF as a guardrail model.

Streaming requirements (seconds cadence) → maintain rolling features in streaming (incremental stats) and score IF online; deep AEs may be too heavy at the edge.

Strong seasonality (weekly/monthly) → use STL decomposition to get seasonal residuals first, then anomaly detection.

Explainability mandated → prefer tree-based models or residual-based methods; accompany each alert with per-tag z-scores vs recent baseline + a short “physics-consistent” narrative (ΔP↑ with flow↓ suggests restriction).

4) Alternative reference structures (drop-in replacements)

Residual-first pipeline:
Baseline forecaster per tag (Kalman/ARIMA/LSTM) → residuals → IsolationForest/One-Class SVM/LOF on residual vectors.

Pros: robust to regimes & drifts; clearer “unexpectedness.”

Cons: you must keep the forecaster healthy.

Sequence model pipeline:
LSTM/TCN autoencoder on multivariate windows → reconstruction error as score.

Pros: learns temporal patterns directly.

Cons: heavier; careful with overfitting.

Dynamic PCA / state-space:
DPCA or Kalman innovations for multivariate correlation → anomaly score from T²/Q statistics.

Pros: classic in process industries; interpretable at system level.

Cons: assumes quasi-linearity.

Hybrid fusion:
Specialized detector for vibration + residual IF for process tags + change-point for temperature. Combine via OR with weights or learned fusion.

5) Validating that your structure is “right enough” (before pilots)

Temporal split backtests (e.g., train on months 1–2, test on month 3; roll forward).

Threshold sweep to match the alarm budget; plot false-alarms/hour vs detection rate. Pick a point the control room accepts.

Event-level analysis: report lead time and misses by event type (bearing, blockage, overload, thermal).

Robustness checks: add artificial noise, missing data bursts, time shifts; verify stability.

Operator review: sample alert replays with plots of Ps/Pd/flow/current/temp/vib + z-scores; collect “makes sense?” feedback.

If it survives those five checks—and operators don’t complain about nuisance alerts—you’re structurally in the right place.

6) What stays invariant vs. what’s swappable

Invariants (almost always keep):

Multivariate viewpoint (physics coupling).

Time context (rolling or sequence).

Alarm budget–based thresholding.

Ops-centric metrics (FA/h, lead time) and event-level reporting.

Governance: temporal splits, seeded reproducibility, clear README with Problem/Data/Method/Metrics/Ops/Cyber/Value.

Swappables (choose per plant):

Feature set (rolling vs residual vs spectral).

Model class (IF vs AE vs DPCA).

Window sizes & lags.

Per-asset vs fleet models.

Fusion rule among specialist detectors.

Bottom line

I built that script to reflect how compressors actually behave, what operators care about, and what you can ship quickly as an unsupervised baseline with honest, ops-facing metrics.

You should keep this structure when your historian shows coupled tags and temporal patterns, labels are sparse, and you need low-overhead, explainable detection with alarm budgets.

You should rebuild differently when operating modes dominate, sequence memory is critical, or specialized physics (e.g., vibration spectra) carries most of the signal—then pivot to residual-first, sequence models, and/or specialist fusion.

If you want, tell me your actual tag list (names, units, scan rates), typical operating modes, and any known incidents. I’ll translate this into a plant-specific blueprint (window sizes, model family, thresholds, and a validation plan) that you can drop straight into your repo.

You’ll nail “accurate + standards-compliant” by turning your build into a disciplined, auditable system across five layers: data, modeling/eval, operations, cybersecurity/safety, and governance. Here’s a tight checklist (with the exact standards to reference) you can copy into your repo’s README and review before any pilot.

1) Data & lineage (plant-grade)

Tag source & access: Document historian/OPC routes (PI Web API endpoints, namespaces, update rates), TLS, and service accounts. Log every extraction with time range, tag list, and query. 
AVEVA Documentation

Time integrity: one timezone, monotonic timestamps, gap policy (FFILL ≤ N minutes), QA flags honored.

Units & ranges: persist engineering units and safety envelopes per tag (Ps, Pd, flow, current, temp, vib).

Reproducibility: export “golden” CSV/Parquet snapshots for each backtest fold with checksums.

P&ID references: map tags to loop/asset IDs using ISA-5.1 conventions in a lookup table (Tag → Loop/Area/Unit). 
isa.org

2) Modeling & evaluation (time-series best practice)

No leakage: use time-aware splits (rolling/expanding window). If you cross-validate, use TimeSeriesSplit. 
Scikit-learn

Context features: justify your window (e.g., 30 min ~ 3–5× slowest time constant). If multiple regimes exist (startup/steady/recycle), either stratify by mode or model residuals.

Threshold = policy: set alarm threshold from an alarm budget (e.g., ≤0.1 FA/hr/asset) on a normal validation slice; never from test data.

Metrics the control room cares about: report AUROC/AUPRC and false-alarms/hour, detection lead time (min) per event.

Model reporting: include a one-page Model Card (intended use, data regimes, metrics at chosen threshold, limitations). 
arXiv

3) Operations & observability (deployable in Gas Ops)

Latency & fail-safe: declare p95 inference latency, sampling/aggregation cadence, and what happens on timeouts (fail open/closed).

Versioning: MLflow (or equivalent) for artifacts + parameters; changelog on every promotion.

Monitoring: export Prometheus metrics for model drift, alert counts, FA/h, and data freshness; put a Grafana panel in the repo.
